    # Access control rules define which roles have access to specific paths.
    # Each rule consists of a path pattern and the roles that are allowed to access it.

    # Example:
    # - { path: ^/admin, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }  # Only users with ROLE_ADMIN can access  paths starting with /admin
    # - { path: ^/profile, roles: ROLE_USER }  # Only users with ROLE_USER can access paths starting with /profile

    - { path: ^/users, roles: ROLE_USER }
    - { path: ^/products, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }
    # - { path: ^/test2, roles: ROLE_USER }
    # - { path: ^/test3, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }
