The Framefox web profiler is a powerful debugging and performance monitoring tool that provides detailed insights into your application's behavior during development. It automatically captures comprehensive data about every HTTP request and presents it through an intuitive web interface.



## Overview

The profiler system transforms debugging from guesswork into precise analysis by automatically capturing detailed information about every HTTP request processed by your Framefox application. Think of it as your application's black box recorder - it tracks everything that happens during a request so you can understand exactly what went right or wrong.

**Key Monitoring Areas:**
- **Request/Response Analysis**: Complete HTTP transaction details with headers, parameters, and timing
- **Database Monitoring**: Every SQL query with execution times and performance metrics
- **Memory Tracking**: Real-time memory usage and peak consumption monitoring
- **Exception Handling**: Full stack traces for Python exceptions and HTTP errors
- **Log Collection**: Centralized application logs with context and intelligent filtering
- **Routing Information**: Controller methods, templates, and routing decision details
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive execution time breakdown and bottleneck identification

## Configuration via debug.yaml

The profiler is configured through the `config/debug.yaml` file, which serves as the central control panel for all debugging features in Framefox. This file allows you to fine-tune the profiler's behavior without touching your application code.

```yaml title="config/debug.yaml"
debug:
  profiler:
    enabled: true # Enable the profiler
    max_files: 1000 # Maximum number of profile files per day
    retention_days: 7 # Number of days to retain profiles
    sampling_rate: 1.0 # Percentage of requests to profile (0.0 to 1.0)
    max_memory: 50 # Maximum profiles in memory
  logging:
    level: "DEBUG" # Log level when dev (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
    file_path: "var/log/app.log"
    max_size: 10 # Maximum file size
    backup_count: 5 # Number of backup files
```

### Understanding debug.yaml Structure

The debug.yaml file is organized into logical sections that control different aspects of the debugging experience:

**Profiler Section (`debug.profiler`):**
- **enabled**: Master switch that controls whether the profiler collects data
- **max_files**: Daily limit for profile files to prevent disk space issues
- **retention_days**: Automatic cleanup period for old profile data
- **sampling_rate**: Performance control - profile only a percentage of requests
- **max_memory**: Memory cache limit to prevent RAM overconsumption

**Logging Section (`debug.logging`):**
- **level**: Controls the verbosity of debug information
- **file_path**: Location where debug logs are stored
- **max_size**: Prevents log files from growing too large
- **backup_count**: Number of rotated log files to maintain

### Environment-Based Activation

The profiler automatically activates only in development mode (`app_env = "dev"`), ensuring zero performance impact in production. This safety mechanism prevents accidental profiling in live environments while maintaining full functionality during development.

**Storage Management:**
Profile data is organized in a hierarchical structure by date, making it easy to locate specific profiles while enabling efficient cleanup of old data.

**Sampling Configuration:**
For high-traffic applications, you can configure sampling to profile only a percentage of requests, reducing overhead while still capturing representative data.

**Automatic Exclusions:**
The profiler automatically excludes certain types of requests that typically don't need profiling:
- Static asset requests (CSS, JS, images)
- Profiler interface requests
- Favicon requests
- Health check endpoints

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

When the profiler doesn't work as expected, there are several common causes and solutions.

**Profiler Not Appearing:**
The most common issue is environment configuration - ensure you're running in development mode and the profiler is enabled in debug.yaml.

**Missing SQL Queries:**
Database query collection depends on proper logging configuration. The profiler integrates with SQLAlchemy and SQLModel loggers to capture database activity.

**Performance Impact:**
If you notice performance degradation, consider adjusting the sampling rate or reducing the number of profiles kept in memory.

**Memory Issues:**
For applications with high request volumes, you may need to reduce the max_files and max_memory settings to prevent resource exhaustion.
